                    Disclaimers seem to have such importance when in reality they have no teeth at all…. for several reasons. First being that it cannot be considered a crime to receive something in error. Furthur to that, what a recipient does with that info is entirely up to them and unless the act itself is criminal (like fraud). Then benefiting from the info is also fair game. it is the equivalent of overhearing people talk while not actually spying and then acting on the talk.<br>
                    Bear in mind that many companies log all emails for various reason. Destroying all copies may not be possible for the recipient.
                    There are many other fallacies related to Disclaimers that are easy to spot if you read into the meaning. Consider removing any threatening penalties or prohibiting “dissemination”. If the email contains criminal information such as “conspiracy to commit” The recipient would be compelled by “actual law to report it.<br>
                    Lastly remember that “Just because you say so” doesn’t make something a binding agreement.
                    Maybe a polite request to delete and inform is all that is needed though most people simply do that as a matter of course.<br>
                    There are several good suggestions in this article that i liked.
